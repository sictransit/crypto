I "needed" to get my hands on a customizable Enigma emulator to crack a mystery geocache, so I wrote one. It seems to be able to decode what other (random) implementations have encoded, so there is hope.

Double-step seems to be working and there are some tests for both arbitrary functions and real (pre-)WW2 messages.
